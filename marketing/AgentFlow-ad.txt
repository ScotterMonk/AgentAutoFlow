Hi all - 

As I work on my primary project with the help of AgentFlow, I sometimes see ways AgentFlow can be improved (and yay those instances are decreasing!). 

Anyway, here's a shiny new version I invite ya'll to play with. Whether you are a senior coder working on a large code base or a newb "vibe coding," it will do much of the heavy-lifting for you.

And as always, I'm open to suggestions/ideas.
