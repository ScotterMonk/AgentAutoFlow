# Useful Discoveries System
**Purpose**: `{base folder}/.roo/docs/useful.md` is a knowledge base for solutions, patterns, and workarounds discovered during development. If missing, create it.

**When to READ from useful.md**:
- Before starting complex or unfamiliar tasks
- When encountering errors or unexpected behavior
- When stuck after trying initial approaches
- Before implementing workarounds or non-obvious solutions
