# CSS coding standards
CSS in a single stylesheet: `static/css/main.css`.

## Syntax & Style
**Vertical spacing**: Keep vertical spacing compact (no excessive blank lines).
**Readability**: Prioritize readable code over "clever" one-liners.
**In-line css**: Prefer use of classes from .css files to in-line css, unless explicitely justified.

## Comments
**Preserve comments**:
- Do NOT delete existing, still relevant comments.
- Organize by component/section with clear comments.
